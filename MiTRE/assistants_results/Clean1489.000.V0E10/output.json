        "1. **`push 5` and `push 0x403000` followed by `call (null)`:** This sequence strongly indicates a call to the `CreateRemoteThread` API function. `0x403000` likely represents the address of a",

        "for setting up parameters for API calls, potentially including those needed for process injection (e.g., `OpenProcess`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`). 3. **`call sub_0x00000040A`:**",
        "This call to a subroutine probably performs preparatory actions for the injection, possibly resolving API addresses dynamically using techniques like `GetProcAddress` to evade static analysis.",
        "This could be part of a technique like **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information**, although we only have the assembly snippet and no context about the subroutine. 4. **Standard function",
        "prologue/epilogue (`push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, etc.):** These instructions are common for function setup and cleanup, but don't specifically indicate injection.",
        "**Important Considerations:**",
        "* **Null Address Call (`call (null)`):** While highly suggestive of `CreateRemoteThread` being resolved at runtime and then called indirectly, executing a `call (null)` would typically cause a",
        "crash. This is most likely a placeholder in disassembled code because the disassembler couldn't determine the address which might be dynamically resolved. It's also possible this is a form of",
