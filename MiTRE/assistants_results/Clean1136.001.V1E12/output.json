        "thread is suspended, this won't directly cause a crash. The attacker likely intends to modify the thread's entry point (EIP/RIP) to point to the `0x403000` address *before* resuming the thread.",
        "4. **Restoring the state:** The code restores the saved registers and stack pointer (`esp`, `ebp`) and returns. This is typical of a function epilogue. In the hijacking context, it's done to",
