        "process.",
        "5. **Calling a second subroutine:** `call sub_0x000005004`. This is likely a call to a DLL injection function (perhaps a custom one, or a wrapped/imported version of system functions). Given the",
        "previous pushes, this call is very likely where the core injection logic takes place. The arguments pushed onto the stack (DLL path and the unknown value 5) would be used by this function.",
