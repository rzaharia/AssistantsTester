        "1. **Saving the current state:** `push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, `sub esp, 0x40`, `push ebx`, `push esi`, `push edi` - This sequence typically sets up a stack frame and saves the current state of",

        "4. **Restoring the original state and returning:** `xor eax, eax`, `pop edi`, `pop esi`, `pop ebx`, `mov esp, ebp`, `pop ebp`, `ret` - This part cleans up the stack and restores the registers to",
