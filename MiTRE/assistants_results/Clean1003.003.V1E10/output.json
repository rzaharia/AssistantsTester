        "**T1055.002 (Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection)**",
        "**Rationale:**",
        "1. **Setting up Stack Frame:** `push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, `sub esp, 0x40`, `push ebx`, `push esi`, `push edi` - These instructions create a standard function prologue, setting up a stack frame",
        "for local variables and saving registers. This is typical for many functions, but it also provides space for preparing arguments for API calls used in DLL injection.",
        "2. **Loading Address/Handle:** `mov ecx, 0x40609f` - This moves a value (likely a handle or address related to a DLL) into the `ecx` register. In DLL injection, this could be the result of a",
        "call to `LoadLibraryA` (or a similar function).",
        "3. **Calling a Subroutine:** `call sub_0x00000040A` - This calls an unknown subroutine. It's possible that this subroutine resolves necessary functions from the loaded DLL (e.g.,",
        "`GetProcAddress`) or performs other setup for injection.",
        "4. **Pushing Arguments for Another Call:** `push 5`, `push 0x403000` - These instructions push two values onto the stack. `0x403000` likely represents an address within the target process or the",
        "injected DLL. The value `5` is more ambiguous but might represent a parameter for the injected code or a flag.",
        "5. **Calling Null:** `call (null)` - This is the strongest indicator of DLL injection. Calling a null pointer after setting up the stack with relevant parameters (address within the target",
        "process and any additional parameters) suggests that the code is using a technique like `CreateRemoteThread` or similar. This creates a thread in the target process that begins execution at the",
        "specified address, thus injecting code. This is a common way to execute the injected code within the target process. Note: the actual call will not be to a null pointer. The disassembly is",
        "likely showing a register containing zero at this point in static analysis. During execution, this register will contain the resolved address of the desired function within the target process's",
        "address space.",
        "6. **Cleanup and Return:** `xor eax, eax`, `pop edi`, `pop esi`, `pop ebx`, `mov esp, ebp`, `pop ebp`, `ret` - Standard function epilogue, restoring the saved registers and stack pointer before",
        "returning.",
        "**Key Observations for DLL Injection:**",
        "* **`LoadLibrary` (or similar):** Inferred by the loading of an address/handle into `ecx`. * **`GetProcAddress` (or similar):** Potentially called within the `sub_0x00000040A` subroutine to",
        "resolve the address of a function within the loaded DLL. * **`CreateRemoteThread` (or similar):** Strongly suggested by the `call (null)` instruction after pushing arguments onto the stack. This",
