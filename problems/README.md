# LLM-Based Naming Problems

This folder contains a collection of **naming problems** designed to evaluate how well large language models (LLMs) can understand code and generate appropriate function names based on **x86/x64 disassembly code**.

## üìå Purpose  
The goal of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of LLMs in:  
- Understanding disassembled code at the function level.  
- Generating meaningful and appropriate function names.  
- Identifying patterns in LLM-generated names and evaluating their accuracy.  

## üß™ Methodology  
1. **Selection of Problems:**  
   - We select **70 functions** that are self-contained, ensuring that an LLM has the full context needed for analysis.  
   - The problems were inspired by mathematical exercises from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/math/index.php).  

2. **LLM Querying:**  
   - Each function is presented to multiple LLMs (in our case, 2, Gemini 1.5 PRO and GPT 4o).  
   - Each LLM generates **five** suggested names per function.  

3. **Data Collection & Extraction:**  
   - The LLM outputs are collected and structured for easier evaluation.  

4. **Evaluation & Rating:**  
   - Each LLM-generated name is manually reviewed and categorized into one of three correctness levels:  
     - **(1) Clearly Indicates Behavior** ‚Äì The name correctly describes the function‚Äôs purpose.  
     - **(2) Descriptive but Not Concise** ‚Äì The name is accurate but overly detailed (e.g., *Describes swapping lines in a matrix* instead of *SwapMatrixLines*).  
     - **(3) Incorrect** ‚Äì The name does not relate to the function‚Äôs actual behavior.  

## üìÇ Folder Structure  

### üìÅ assistants_results/  
Contains the LLM outputs for each problem. Each problem is stored in a separate folder, which includes the following files:  
- **output.json** ‚Äì Extracted LLM answers from the visual interface.  
- **pX.gemini.gview** ‚Äì Gemini‚Äôs response in text format.  
- **pX.gpt4o.gview** ‚Äì GPT-4o‚Äôs response in text format.  
- **voted.json** ‚Äì Manual ratings for each LLM-generated function name.  

(*Here, "pX" refers to a specific problem, e.g., `p1.gemini.gview` and `p1.gpt4o.gview` for problem 1.*)  

### üìÅ sources/  
Contains the **original source code** used for the evaluation.
