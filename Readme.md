Welcome to the repository for, where we showcase our work on automated source code generation using MITRE techniques and various data needed for the LLM prompts. 
This repository contains everything needed to reproduce, analyze, and extend our research.

## üìÇ Repository Contents
This repository is structured into several key components:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Framework for Source Code Generation
* A system that automatically generates source code from a CSV file containing MITRE data.
* Designed to streamline the process of converting structured threat intelligence into executable code.
  
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Manually Written Source Code
* Handcrafted source code files created to complement the generated code.
* These serve as reference implementations and help validate the generated outputs.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ LLM-Based Naming Problems
* A collection of naming problems used when querying LLMs for renaming variables, functions, and other identifiers.
* Helps analyze how LLMs interpret and suggest improvements for generated code.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Project for Building Source Files
* The build system and configuration files required to compile all source code files.
* Ensures reproducibility and easy deployment of the generated and manual code.
